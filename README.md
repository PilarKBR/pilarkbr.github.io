## Undergraduate Student of Computer Science at Pakuan University | Ex-Data Science & AI Mentee and MSIB Batch 6 Tribe at Startup Campus

Hi, I'm Pilar Kukuh Bintang Rachmadi, many people call me Pilar. Currently, I'm a Final Semester Semester Computer Science Undergraduate Student at Pakuan University. I'm a very curious and detail-oriented person, therefore I am highly motivated to always be learning and adaptive to new things, and that is why I am very interested in Data-related issues

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Looker Studio, Excel

## Projects
- ### Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis and K-means with Prediction

  - #### Workflow Explanatory
    [Medium Story in Bahasa](https://medium.com/@pilarkbr/segmentasi-pelanggan-menggunakan-rfm-dan-k-means-978f2cfa5ca4)
  
  - #### Notebooks
    To see the details of the notebook used can be accessed through [Notebooks (Include Final Project on Startup Campus & Medium Story Needs)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kC1dS0MDsBoOxX-HXtIWr1e7uJVTd_HS?usp=sharing) Because Github cannot load large files

  - #### Goal
    Developed objective strategy for Understand customers in depth and identify groups of customers who have similar needs, preferences, or buying behaviors using **RFM Analysis** with then customer segmentating is done using **K-means** and the predicted results of their total spending using **ARIMA** 

  - #### Summary of Insights
    - Clusters formed from the application of K-means on RFM Scores for this dataset amounted to 5 clusters
    - Cluster Profiling
         - Bottom (Cluster 3): The average user is a Loyal Prospective User with Low Total transactions, but Lowest Spending compared to other clusters.
         - Middle to Lower (Cluster 4): The average user is a Loyal Prospective User with Total transactions classified as Lowest, but Spending is Lowest
         - Middle (Cluster 0): The average user is a Loyal Prospective User with Total transactions and Expenses classified as Medium
         - Upper Middle (Cluster 2): Their shopping frequency is fairly low, but once they make a transaction, the amount spent and the total transactions they make are high
         - Upper (Cluster 1): Their shopping frequency is low, but once they make a transaction, the amount spent and the total transaction they make are the highest among other groups.

  - #### Actions to be taken for each Cluster
    - Bottom (Cluster 3):
    Most Item Category Predictions for each Lower Cluster (Cluster 3) on notebooks show stable predictions, so offering affordable promos on other item categories is an appropriate action for the Lower Cluster.
    - Middle to Lower (Cluster 4):
    Provide promos (can be in the form of discount vouchers, cashback, etc.) for certain categories of goods, which are tailored to the category of goods that each customer has purchased in the past 1 year.
    - Middle (Cluster 0):
    Provide personalized item recommendations based on their transaction history and provide attractive promos on the categories of goods they often buy.
    - Upper middle class (Cluster 2):
    If we look again, the movement of the graph of the amount of expenditure of the upper middle class in one month is on average stable, but the range of the amount of expenditure will always vary every month.
    This is reinforced by the movement of the graph of the total expenditure of each category of goods and the prediction of the Upper Middle class is the same as described earlier, so this Upper Middle class customer is likely to be a seasonal customer.
    Therefore, the right action for upper middle class customers is in the form of providing recommendations and attractive promos on the category of goods that are in season/trend for the next 1 month.
    - Upper (Cluster 1):
    Apply the bundle method for several categories of goods and/or provide more services & benefits than other groups.'

    - #### Results
      Do some test on many common Classification Alghorithm to detect alzhemier disease on some patient based on their medical history and alzheimer status, And Ada Boost Classifier Algorithm (After Hyperparameter tuning with Estimator Parameters: learning_rate=1.1866863319867205 and n_estimators=25) is completely suitable for detecting alzheimer's disease in patients with 81,4% accuracy on Precision metrics

    - #### Results
      Implementating some Regression Models to the dataset, after do comparation test on scatter between SalePrice and GrLivArea, XGBoost Regressor bring up the biggest accuracy between all Regression Models that used in the test within R2 Scores metrics about 0.906394
